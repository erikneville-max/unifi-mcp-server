## Example Workflows

```
# Pre-maintenance backup
Trigger backup on site "default", wait for completion, then validate the
backup before proceeding with firmware upgrades

# Investigate bandwidth spike
Get top flows for the last 30 minutes, then get client flow aggregation
to identify which device is responsible

# Block Netflix on guest network
Get DPI categories, find the streaming category ID, then block_flow_application
for that category on the guest VLAN zone

# Set up RADIUS for WPA2-Enterprise
Create RADIUS profile with your auth server, then update the corporate SSID
to use WPA2-Enterprise with that profile

# Route IoT traffic through VPN
Create traffic route: source=IoT-VLAN, gateway=VPN-tunnel, priority=high
```
